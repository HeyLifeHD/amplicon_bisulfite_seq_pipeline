<br>

AmpliconDesign has an automated bisulfite primer blast algorithm which allows users to analyze whether designed primers show mutliple alignment sites in a bisulfite converted genome. 
<br>

The following input parameters should be specified:

<br>

#### **Select Genome**
Selection of the genome assembly. Users can choose between GRCh38/hg38, GRCh27/hg19 and GRCm38/mm10.

<br>

#### **Primer Input**
Users can input the primer sequence of interest (primer for bisulfite converted genome only). <br>
